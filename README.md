# Go_PyProj
Creates a simple folder with a starter file (mainly .py or .go files), .gitignore and README.md

## Installation

Detailed instructions can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/oliverchen415/go_pyproj/wiki/Installation).

For Windows, download the executable from [Releases](https://github.com/oliverchen415/go_pyproj/releases) and add its location to $PATH. 

For MacOS/Linux, you'll need to build the binaries yourself then add it to $PATH.

## Usage
From a terminal, `cd` into your workspace, e.g. `Documents`. Then enter
```
go_pyproj -name=<project_name> -type=<file_type>
```

`-name` and/or `-type` can be blank. In that case, it will default to a Python project named `dummyProj`.

Some examples and additional information can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/oliverchen415/go_pyproj/wiki/Usage).
